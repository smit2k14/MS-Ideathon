We want to provide education to the places where internet connectivity is minimal. Hence, we use a compression algorithm to compress the videos and a summarizer to summarize the entire notes of the lecture or any reading material. For example, if you wanted to know about the history of Donald Trump, and you passed in the entire wiki article, it would provide you with the summarized text

### Usage

For summarizer, run 

```
python3 summarizer.py (no-of-summarized-sentences)
```
